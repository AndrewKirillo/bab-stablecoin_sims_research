# Simulating Previous Financial Crises with Stablecoin Currency

This is a research project conducted by Blockchain @ Berkeley that aims to simulate how previous financial crises, such as the 2008 Great Recession, might have played out if the currency in use at the time was a stablecoin.

We will be using an algorithmic / seigniorage share-based stablecoin such as Basis or Celo for this research.

We aim to simulate both how the economy would react with just stablecoins as the currency, ceteris paribus, as well as experiment with a model of the economy that accounts for other changes that would reasonably be imposed if a stablecoin cryptocurrency was instituted.
